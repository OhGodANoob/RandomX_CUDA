# RandomX CUDA implementation

This repository contains full RandomX implementation for NVIDIA GPUs. The latest version of RandomX (as of May 7th, 2019) is supported.

Note: it's only a benchmark/testing tool, not an actual miner. The code is NOT optimized to the limit yet. RandomX hashrate is expected to improve somewhat in the future.

GPUs tested so far:

Model|CryptonightR H/S|RandomX H/S|Relative speed
-----|---------------|-----------|--------------
GTX 1660 Ti|620|554|89.4%
